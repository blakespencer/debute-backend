# Project TODOs

This file tracks project-level development tasks and future enhancements.

## Current Sprint

### Shopify Integration üöß
**Goal**: Create a read-only Shopify integration that syncs order data from a single Shopify store into our PostgreSQL database for analytics and reporting.

**What we're trying to achieve**:
- Automatically import order data from our Shopify store
- Store detailed order information including pricing, line items, and customer data
- Handle multi-currency transactions properly with Shopify's MoneyBag format
- Enable analytics on sales data without constantly hitting Shopify's API
- Provide a foundation for revenue analytics and business intelligence

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Design Prisma models for ShopifyStore, ShopifyOrder, and ShopifyLineItem with proper flattened MoneyBag fields
2. ‚úÖ **API Client**: Create Shopify GraphQL client for fetching order data with proper authentication
3. ‚úÖ **Data Sync Service**: Build sync service that can handle incremental updates and error recovery
4. ‚úÖ **Repository Layer**: Create database operations for storing and updating Shopify data
5. ‚úÖ **Controller & Routes**: Expose REST endpoints for triggering syncs and querying synced data
6. üöß **Database Migration**: Update Prisma models and generate migration
7. ‚è≥ **Testing**: Test the sync with real Shopify data
8. ‚è≥ **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling and logging for sync failures
9. ‚è≥ **Analytics Integration**: Connect synced Shopify data to existing analytics endpoints
10. ‚è≥ **Performance Baseline**: Add basic response time logging to analytics endpoints
11. ‚è≥ **Database Optimization**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (orderDate, status)

**Routes Available**:
- `POST /shopify/sync` - Trigger order sync from Shopify
- `GET /shopify/test` - Test Shopify API connection
- `GET /shopify/orders` - Get synced orders with pagination

- Move completed items to "Completed" section
- Use this file for project-level tasks (not code-level TODOs)
- Code-level TODOs should be inline comments for specific fixes
