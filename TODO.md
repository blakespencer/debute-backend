## MVP Core: Shopify + SWAP + Business Intelligence üéØ

**Mission**: Build a comprehensive DTC analytics platform focused on Shopify sales data, SWAP returns integration, and advanced business intelligence for data-driven decision making.

### Shopify Integration üöß
**Goal**: Complete read-only Shopify integration that syncs all order data for comprehensive analytics.

**What we're trying to achieve**:
- Comprehensive order data import from Shopify (orders, customers, products, variants)
- Store detailed pricing, line items, customer data, and product information
- Handle multi-currency transactions with Shopify's MoneyBag format
- Foundation for all business intelligence and analytics
- Support for advanced analytics: cohorts, LTV, product performance, customer segmentation

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Design Prisma models for ShopifyStore, ShopifyOrder, and ShopifyLineItem with proper flattened MoneyBag fields
2. ‚úÖ **API Client**: Create Shopify GraphQL client for fetching order data with proper authentication
3. ‚úÖ **Data Sync Service**: Build sync service that can handle incremental updates and error recovery
4. ‚úÖ **Repository Layer**: Create database operations for storing and updating Shopify data
5. ‚úÖ **Controller & Routes**: Expose REST endpoints for triggering syncs and querying synced data
6. ‚úÖ **Database Migration**: Update Prisma models and generate migration
7. ‚úÖ **Analytics Integration**: Connect synced Shopify data to existing analytics endpoints
8. ‚úÖ **Database Optimization**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (createdAt, displayFinancialStatus)
9. üöß **Integration Testing**: Basic integration tests implemented, but coverage needs expansion
10. ‚è≥ **Unit Testing**: Unit test scaffolding exists but implementation is empty
11. ‚è≥ **Real Data Testing**: Test the sync with actual Shopify store data
12. ‚è≥ **Error Handling Enhancement**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging for sync failures
13. ‚è≥ **Performance Baseline**: Add basic response time logging to analytics endpoints

**Routes Available**:
- `POST /shopify/sync` - Trigger order sync from Shopify
